Hi, I'm Amy.

I'm a data scientist, software engineer, and amongst many other things, I care about AI safety and security.

It's a New Year resolution of mine to start blogging better - after that, I'll be able to figure out what it's all about.

If you're looking for my career history and experience, find it on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/myndrws/).

If you're looking for code, my personal GitHub lives [here](https://github.com/myndrws), and my work [here](https://github.com/aandrews-dsit) (look out for imminent open sourcing).
